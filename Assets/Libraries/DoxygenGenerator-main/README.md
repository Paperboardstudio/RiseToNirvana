# DoxygenGenerator
A quick way to generate API documentation from inside Unity using [doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html), with [doxygen-awesome](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) styling. Useful for generating API of your custom packages. Special thanks to [JacobPennock](https://forum.unity.com/members/jacobpennock.53178/) for the original implementation and [Brogrammar](https://forum.unity.com/members/brogrammar.1045220/) for an updated version that works with more modern versions of Unity.

Watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/ltJgXJjS_YQ) to get started.

Note that this is a personal utility tool, not a reliably supported package (I mean just look at this shoddy README). I may make changes to the styling or code at any point without warning, so it may be best to fork this project for yourself. But hey, if you _do_ make any valuable additions, contributions are always welcome!
